The primary focus of our research is to examine the impact of socioeconomic factors, particularly poverty, on educational outcomes. The "School Neighborhood Poverty Estimates 2019-20" dataset aligns closely with this objective by providing detailed information about poverty levels within the neighborhoods surrounding schools. Regarding socioeconomic factors including poverty rates, median household income, and demographics, the dataset provides a thorough overview of estimates of poverty. We can do complex studies and develop a sophisticated understanding of the socioeconomic environment around schools because of the depth of information available.
We will carefully examine the dataset before starting our research to make sure the data is reliable and intact. This entails looking at the data's origin, the methods used to obtain it, and any biases or constraints that might have an impact on its validity.
We will verify that the dataset's variables align with both our analytical approach and our research objectives. This means confirming the existence of important information needed for our study, like geographic identifiers, demographic characteristics, and poverty rates.
To gain a fundamental understanding of the dataset, we will utilize exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. This will help us assess how rich and valuable the data is for our study.
